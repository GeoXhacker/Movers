 Hi there... it kinda took me a while to replay, not that am still mad at u but coz i didnt know what to say. Anyways u am gratefull that someone actually appreciates wat i try to do for the family. Thanks for all the compliments, they meant  a lot to me.
 Yes ur behaviour was inappropriate and disrespectful, I've been observing u for a while now. And i've realised tht u have what in psychology they call a distorted self-image; This makes u think that what ur peers percieve of u, is what is important and required of u, which is not always the case. This makes u do a lot of things to prove ur self to them.Jst know that their perception of u doesn't matter at all. Trust me i've bn there and I know ur peers(friends) put pressure on u to conform to their standards, But what u have to know is that they dont know any better, they are young and naive; In other wards most the things they do and want u do, are not right and totally irrational. Therefore u always have to take caution of whatever decision they force u into. Which brings me to another issue tht have been wanting to talk to u about; I can clearly see that u didnt pick a word from all that i said to u the other time when u were going through a heartbreak, I told u not to give in ever again when it comes to the relationship stuff coz y'all are still young and you are going to end up ruining ur lives. Just stop which every relationship u are in coz for a fact they are aint gonna bring u anything good, they jst gonna bring unneccesary drama in ur life.  Just because ur peers do it, it dont mean u gotta also do it. As hard as its gonna be be trust me it will be worth it. 
 You should use ur brain, the almighty Allah give it to u for a reason;  u are a brilliant girl but it breaks ma heart when i see u not using ur brilliance in certain situations. You are lucky that u got someone to talk to u about all this but i never had anyone, I had to teach ma self how most things in life work. jst know its hard as u can ever imagine.
Anyways this all i can say to u for now, jst take care of ur self... eat more often, , dont let ur stomach go empty; you wouldn't want ur condition to result into actual ulcers. Anyways i love you lil sis. 
I'll be waiting for ur response. Aslm alykm
Bye
